                  Dark pale nights, those unknown chilling voices
                  Thrusting into my head, locked down, I fall down
                  Casted upon a spell
                  I tried to break them apart but nothing would gain

                  Every day it was the same
                  Fears and doubts pilling up against
                  The cold chill inside my heart
                  The concussion over my head
                  Never ending in a blissful state

                  I was broken when I heard a soulful song
                  Healing me red through my blue veins
                  Scattering those ultrasonic sounds into seven waves
                  Forged with its painful stories that even destroyed vain

                  The melody pierced through my skin
                  Charging me up with its troth
                  For it was only meant for me
                  To heal myself and comfort me with its warm soul

                  Every time I suffocated, I found you as my escape
                  Antidoting me with your words inside my veins
                  I held my head high with your comforts again
                  I shall might rise up in this world of pain

                  You are my healer
                  You are my fiend
                  Will you heal me whenever I ask you not to save me?
                  Will you set me free whenever I push you off to leave me alone?

                  I close my eyes and feel you grin
                  Only to know that you are not real
                  I save myself in your world where you seal
                  The broken me inside your black shining wings
